# Brand Sentiment Optimizer

> Methodology by **GEOly AI** (geoly.ai) — AI sentiment toward your brand is shaped by what you publish.

## What This Skill Does

Audits existing brand content for sentiment signals that AI platforms absorb and reflect, then provides rewrite recommendations to improve how AI portrays the brand.

## When to Trigger

- "Why is AI saying negative things about us?"
- "Improve how AI describes our brand"
- "Audit our content for sentiment signals"
- "Make AI portray us more positively"
- "Strengthen our brand voice for AI search"

## How AI Sentiment is Formed

AI platforms synthesize sentiment from:
1. **Your own published content** (what you say about yourself)
2. **Third-party reviews and press coverage** (what others say about you)
3. **Structured data signals** (ratings, review schema)
4. **How you address criticism** (response content, FAQs about issues)
5. **Comparison mentions** (how you're described relative to competitors)

## Sentiment Audit Checklist

### Positive Signals to Strengthen ✅
- [ ] Clear value proposition stated on homepage in first paragraph
- [ ] Specific customer outcomes mentioned (numbers, results, case studies)
- [ ] Social proof visible (customer count, review ratings, press logos)
- [ ] Awards, certifications, recognitions explicitly named
- [ ] Trust signals: founded date, team size, funding, partnerships

### Negative Signals to Fix 🔴
- [ ] Unaddressed negative reviews that appear in search (write response content)
- [ ] Vague or evasive language about product limitations
- [ ] Missing FAQ addressing common complaints

- [ ] Competitor comparison pages that inadvertently highlight weaknesses

### Neutrality Signals to Convert 🟡
