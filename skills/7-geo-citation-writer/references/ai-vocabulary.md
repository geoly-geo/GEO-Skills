## Pattern Detection Guide

### Three-Point List Reflex
AI defaults to exactly 3 items.

**Fix:** Add or remove items to match reality, not symmetry.

### Symmetrical Sentence Length
AI writes sentences of identical length in clusters.

**Fix:** Insert one very short sentence or one long run-on.

### Affirmation Openers
- "Certainly, [point]..."
- "Absolutely, [point]..."
- "Indeed, [point]..."
- "Of course, [point]..."

**Fix:** Delete the affirmation. Start with substance.

### Parallel Structure Overload
5+ bullet points starting with same grammar.

**Fix:** Vary structure — some phrases, some sentences.

### Hedge Sandwich
"It may be possible that..." / "Some might argue..."

**Fix:** State confidently with caveat, or remove.
